# Physics involved

There are two equations that are solved simultaneously to get the final velocities of two masses, say of mass $m1$ and $m2$

## Energy Conservation
The kinetic energy of the system is conserved throughout. So the total Kinetic Energy of the system is constant throughout
Mathematically, kinetic energy can be written as ${MV^2 \over 2}$ <br>
- M = mass of object <br>
- V = velocity of object

Hence, for the entire system, we can write the equation as :
${M_1V_1^2 \over 2}$ + ${M_2V_2^2 \over 2}$ = ${M_1V_1'^2 \over 2}$ + ${M_2V_2'^2 \over 2}$ <br>
- ${V_1'}$ and ${V_2'}$ are velocities after collision

Further, this equation can we written as:<br>
<br>
${M_1V_1^2}$ + ${M_2V_2^2}$ = ${M_1V_1'^2}$ + ${M_1V_1'^2}$

## Momentum Conservation
The net momentum of this system is also conserved. <br> 
Mathematically it is written as ${MV}$ <br>
Hence ${M_1V_1}$ + ${M_2V_2}$ = ${M_1V_1'}$ + ${M_1V_1'}$

## Solution
On solving the two equations, we get: <br>
${V_2'}$ = ${2M_1 \over M_1 + M_2}$ * ${V_1}$ - ${M_1 - M_2 \over M_1 + M_2}$ * ${V_2}$ <br>
${V_1'}$ = ${2M_1 \over M_1 + M_2}$ * ${V_1}$ + ${M_1 - M_2 \over M_1 + M_2}$ * ${V_2}$ <br>

These are the equations used in radial and tangential directions.
